# Stories

This is where all storybook related content lives within the application.

The folder structure should roughly match that of the application itself.

For example, a component living in:

```
/components/core/Button/Button.tsx
```

will have a corresponding storybook in:

```
/stories/components/core/Button/Button.tsx
```

Storybook should be reserved for _simple_ components only.
